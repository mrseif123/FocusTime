# FocusTime
My first attempt in React-Native with A simple app for implementing the Pomodoro timing technique, with timer and vibration functionality, in addition to history of practiced items.

## Project Technological Stack:
* Expo for quick start and deployment.
* ReactJS for the UI.
* Javascript for typing.
* StyledComponents for styling.
* React Context for state management.
* Google Cloud API's: Google Maps, Google Places.
* Firebase for Authorization.

## Usage:
* To run locally:\
      1. Clone this repo.\
      2. Run `npm install` to install all dependecies.\
      3. Run `npm run android` to start on Android device (requires adb & Android Studio) or `npm run ios` to run on IOS Simulator (requires xCode). Or simply connect your device.\
      4. Wait for build to complete, enjoy!.\
